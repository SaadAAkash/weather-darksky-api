* [App for showing basic weather forecast for chosen city in Kotlin](https://github.com/KonradSzewczuk/WeatherApp/)
* [A weather Android app by Kotlin](https://github.com/hugojing/kotlin-weather-app)
* [Official Kotlin Reference](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/)

### File Uses

* ```<PROJECT_ROOT>\build.gradle``` : Top-level build file with configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules
* ```<PROJECT_ROOT>\app\build.gradle``` : Gradle specific for app module with libraries used
    * If you use another module in your project, as a local library, you would have another build.gradle file: ```<PROJECT_ROOT>\module\build.gradle```
* ```_config.yml``` for setting up jekyll environment
* Change ```<PROJECT_ROOT>\app\proguard-rules.pro``` if you add Java codes, guard for kotline codes have been added. Uncomment lines if you want to preserve the line number information for debugging stack traces
